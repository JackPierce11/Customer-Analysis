# Customer Analysis
This project aims to identify customer segments, determine key customer characteristics that impact purchasing behavior, and provide actionable insights and recommendations for targeting specific customer segments and improving overall sales and revenue.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer along with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, spending habits, and campaign participation.

## Project Contents
This project consists of the following sections:

- Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant columns, addressing missing values, and removing outliers
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, distribution analysis, and investigation of relationships between variables
- Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on demographic information and analyzing differences in purchasing behavior across groups
- Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib & Seaborn to create informative and visually appealing charts and plots
- Recommendations: Providing marketing and product development suggestions based on the analysis of customer segments and their preferences

## Limitations
It is important to note that the dataset only includes information about customers who have already engaged with the company, potentially leading to sampling bias and limiting the generalizability of the findings to the wider population. Additionally, the analysis assumes that customer behavior is primarily driven by demographic information, potentially overlooking other important factors that impact purchasing decisions. The analysis does not take into account external factors, such as economic or social trends, which may influence customer behavior and impact the validity of the findings.

## Insights and Recommendations
Through the analysis of customer data, this project identified key customer segments and characteristics that significantly impact purchasing behavior. The following insights and recommendations were made:

- High-income customers exhibit the highest average total spending, mean purchase value per order, and response rate to campaigns. Targeting these customers with exclusive and expensive products could lead to increased sales and revenue.
- The catalog sales channel showed the highest average total spending and mean purchase value per order. Customers who preferred this channel also had the highest response rate to campaigns. Investing more in the catalog sales channel could help reach more customers and generate more sales.
- Customers who participated in more campaigns had higher average total spending and mean purchase value per order. Encouraging customer participation in campaigns can lead to higher spending and purchase values.
- One-person households displayed the highest average total spending, mean purchase value per order, and response rate to campaigns. Offering products and services catering to one-person households, such as smaller and more affordable packages or personalized experiences, can drive higher sales and customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
The insights and recommendations provided by this project can help the company tailor its marketing campaigns and product offerings to meet the needs and preferences of specific customer segments. By implementing these strategies, the business can increase sales and revenue while enhancing customer satisfaction.
